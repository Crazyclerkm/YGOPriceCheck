# YGOPriceCheck

YGOPriceCheck is a project aimed at collecting product data from a list of specified Shopify shops, collating this information into a database, and then providing a server and website to access this information for end users. 

Originally designed to be used for New Zealand based vendors of single cards for the trading card game Yu-Gi-Oh!, although should be compatible with all Shopify webstores.
